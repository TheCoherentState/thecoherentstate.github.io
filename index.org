Welcome to The Coherent State: the knowledge directory and project catalogue of [[https://lucaman99.github.io][Jack Ceroni]].

This is essentially version 2.0 of my personal website. I'm hoping that this will be the place where 
I store information related to all of the projects I'm working on, notes, my more informal blog, other writings, solutions to interesting problems, and 
more.

Stay tuned for more content (see below).

+ *Directory:* A collection of notes, and solutions to interesting math/physics problems, among other technical writings: [[https://thecoherentstate.github.io/directory]]
+ *Blog:* Informal writings, and monthly retrospectives (formal essays are reserved for Substack): https://thecoherentstate.github.io/blog
