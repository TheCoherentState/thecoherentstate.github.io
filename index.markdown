## The Coherent State

Welcome to The Coherent State: the knowledge directory and project catalogue of [Jack Ceroni](https://lucaman99.github.io).

This is essentially the second versiomn of my personal website. I'm hoping that this will be the place where 
I store information related to all of the projects I'm working on, my blog, other writings, solutions to interesting problems, and 
more.

Stay tuned for more content (see below)!
